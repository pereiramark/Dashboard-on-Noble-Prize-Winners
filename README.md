# Dashboard-on-Noble-Prize-Winners
This is my submission for Onyx Data, novyPro and Astrato Analytics May 2022 Challenge. The Data analysis and visualization is done for the Nobel Prize Winners Dataset from the year 1901 to 2019. The main aim was to identify which country has won the most prizes in each category.
